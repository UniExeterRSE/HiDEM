# Purpose: define a glacier similar to the Helheim glacier/Greenland with a water depth of 600m and 100m high above-water cliffs
#          the domain is 4km wide (approx width at the terminus) and 10km long with 8km of it taken up by the ice block.
#          the ice thus that 2km to collapse into in the y-direction. The water depth is 600m at the mouth
# Result:
